# MAD-Training-Bangla || বাংলা

Welcome to the MAD-Training-Bangla repository! This repository contains recorded sessions that teach Modern Android Development (MAD) using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, all in Bangla. These videos cover key concepts in Android development and Kotlin programming, following Google's [Modern Android Development](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course) guidelines. 

Most of the videos are inspired by the [Android Basics with Compose course](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course) provided by Google, and aim to help learners get started with Android development using Kotlin and Compose.

## Testimonials

> "Dear Khalid Saifullah Sir,  Your teaching sessions were very interesting. You always tried to hold everyone's attention. The assignment-type projects you gave after each session were very effective. And I used to try to finish them at once so that my confusions would be cleared. And then I got stuck somewhere, and you tried to solve me. Overall, I like your teaching style very much; you used to solve all the problems in a very friendly manner.If I had any problem with the project, you would respond very quickly, for which I would get more inspiration and dedication. If I was feeling down about a project, you would always try to motivate me. Thank you for helping me throughout my Android developer journey."

> "I participated in this course, and it inspired my interest in native Android development. Although I’m not a highly professional developer, most of what I know about development comes from this course.
I highly recommend this course to all beginners. I hope it helps others as much as it has helped me."
